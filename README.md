COB-Web-Development-Intern-Pinaki-Typing-Speed-Test-Phase-1-Task-1

During my internship, I dedicated myself to honing my skills in web development by completing a project focused on creating a Typing-Speed-Test application. Through this endeavor, I delved into the realms of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, mastering the essential components of front-end development. Crafting the user interface with HTML and CSS allowed me to ensure an intuitive and visually appealing design, while leveraging JavaScript empowered me to implement interactive features that enhanced the user experience. This project not only provided me with a deeper understanding of web development principles but also instilled in me a sense of accomplishment as I successfully navigated the complexities of creating a functional and engaging web application as per the task of CodesOnBytes i.e., Web Development ----Phase-1-TASK-1.
